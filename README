You'll need a "microdescs-*" download from collector.torproject.org.  Unpack
it here. You'll need to edit the scripts if you pick something besides Jan
2017.

You'll need stem and sqlite3.

This probably is not a very efficient way to do this analysis.  I mainly
wanted to practice something simple with stem and sqlite.

First, you run populate*py, to make some big sqlite databases.  I hope you
have a few free GB of disk space!

Then you run analyze*py, to generate output on stdout.

The populate.py and analyze.py scripts are for looking at microdescriptor
change over time.  The analysis script produces lines like this:

000a10d43011ea4928a35f610405f92b4433b4dc => 5 5 / 674 oO oO oO oO

Meaning:
   000a10d43011ea4928a35f610405f92b4433b4dc -- relay fingerprint
   5   This relay had 5 distinct microdescriptors.
   5   This relay had 5 unbroken sequences of having the same md.
   674 This relay appeared in 674 consensuses
   oO  The first time this relay's microdesc changed, its onion keys both
       changed
    ...

The letter codes indicating changes in microdescriptors are:

   ('o', 'onion_key'),
   ('O', 'ntor_onion_key'),
   ('a', 'or_addressses'),
   ('f', 'family'),
   ('4', 'exit_policy'),
   ('6', 'exit_policy_v6'),
   ('k', 'identifiers'),
   ('p', 'protocols')

The populate-consenus and analyze-consensus.py scripts look at routerstatus
change over time in the consensus.  They produce lines that look like:

000a10d43011ea4928a35f610405f92b4433b4dc => 58 59 / 674 +* dw d dM d w d w F Fw d d w d F d w dvV w dw d dM d d -* +* w F d w d d d w d dM d dw w d w d d d -* +* d F F d dM d d d d d d d d F dFv

Meaning:
  000a10d43011ea4928a35f610405f92b4433b4dc -- relay fingerprint
  58  this relay had 58 distinct routerstatus blocks
  59  this relay had 59 unbroken sequences with the same routerstatus block
  674  this relay appeared in 674 consensuses
   +*  First this relay appeared
   dw  Then its publication date and bandwidth weight changed
   d   Then its publication date changed.
   dM  Then its publication date and microdesc hash changed.
    ...


The letter codes are:

-*   entry removed
+*   entry added

('n', 'nickname'),
('i', 'fingerprint'),
('a', 'address'),
('d', 'published'),
('p', 'or_port'),
('P', 'dir_port'),
('F', 'flags'),
('v', 'version_line'),
('V', 'protocols'),
('w', 'bandwidth'),
('W', 'measured'),
('u', 'unrecognized_bandwidth_entries'),
('M', 'digest')

I put the results from January in the results subdirectory.
